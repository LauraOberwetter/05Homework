# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## This Program

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to list their daily tasks by hour. The hour rows are dynamically programmed to change color in relation to the current time. Time periods that have already occured are grey, periods in the future are green, and the current time period is red. The header displays the current date and the content recorded within the task bar is saveable by clicking the save icon.
